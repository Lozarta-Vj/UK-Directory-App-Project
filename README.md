# Developing Database
I contributed to a charity app development project as a data analyst in a voluntary role.
As part of the data team, I helped develop a UK-wide directory for a new app that aims to connect people with essential resources.

I used **Python** and **API’s** to extract data from two sources: the Charity Commission for England and Wales, and Give Food.

With guidance from my team lead, templates, and tools, I refined my code. I used **SQL** to perform data quality checks and join multiple tables into a single database of nearly 1,000 access points (food banks).

# Creating Dashboard 

I created a Tableau dashboard that helped the team understand the information, identify data errors, and improve the database for the app's development. It visually showed: 

* **Where resources are located:** A map of the UK highlighting the distribution of access points.
* **The registration status of charities:** active, inactive, and unknown charity statuses.
* **Records of access points added:** showing the growth of the Give Food database, as records of access points were added each year they were found.

I maintained a neutral and professional tone throughout, using the terms "food and resource support" and "access points”. This was to ensure the information was accessible and respectful for a general audience.
